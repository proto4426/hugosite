## Tech

I recently switched to Linux for my primary personal computer. I use [crouton](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton) on an [Acer c720 Chromebook](http://us.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/series/c720). It runs all day on a single charge and is extraordinarily capable, thank you very much. (I still keep my old macbook pro around for some things, but it's increasingly just a data server).

I blog and maintain my website using a combination of Octopress/Jekyll, markdown, nearlyfreespeech, and Git.

## Academic input

[Docear](http://www.docear.org/) is the long-sought-after solution to my literature organization conundrum--and then some. I use it for organizing all kinds of things. But it's built for--and works well with--academic literature (i.e. pdfs of journal articles).

I'm a fan of MOOCs (massive open online courses) to be very useful, particularly for topics in math and CS. I feel compelled to say that [I was on the MOOC bandwagon before you were](letter132937_signed.pdf). Some of my notes from various MOOCs are [over here](wiki/mooc).

## Academic output

I do a lot of statistical computing using [R](https://www.r-project.org/). This is not the place for an exhaustive list of R-related tools I use, for they are many. I'm (sometimes) working on a guide to getting started with R [over here](../rguide/)

[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) deserves special mention. It's an open-source IDE for R with lots of useeful integrations. The RStudio team (which includes the prodigious and prolific Hadley Wickham) puts out many good packages and has assumed flagship status in the R flotilla. 

I use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control. Some of my repositories also live on [Github](https://github.com/), but generally not my in-progress research projects. 

I now write most things in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) / [RMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). I find this is a good middle-ground between Word (proprietary, poor math support, poor version control integration) and LaTeX (steep learning curve, hard-to-read source). [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) converts Markdown to just about any format I could want, including LaTeX and docx. For things where real-time rendering is important, e.g. equation-heavy documents, I've started using [Haroopad](http://pad.haroopress.com/). [editR](https://github.com/swarm-lab/editR) is an attempt--still in development--to do something similar for RMarkdown. I've only used it a smidge and found the current version to be unreliable (lots of crashes). 

## Non-open-source

Sometimes the thing you need is the thing that works, and the thing that works is proprietary. Here are some that I find useful enough to spring for the premium version:

- [Evernote](https://evernote.com/)
- [Feedly](http://feedly.com/i/welcome)
- [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/)
- [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/)
    - also [Insync](https://www.insynchq.com/), for syncing my Drive with my Linux machine.

## Bike

I ride a [Surly Cross-Check](http://surlybikes.com/bikes/cross_check), which I use for everything from commuting to touring to (ocasionally) racing. 

## Podcasts

I listen to a lot of podcasts. Here are my favorites (in the order in which I think of them, which roughly corresponds to my degree of admiration)

- Radiolab
- Planet Money
- 99% Invisible
- Reply All
- Startup
- BBC Global News / The World This Week
- This American Life
- The Moth
- Song Exploder
- All Songs Considered
- Conversation Parade (an Adventure Time podcast)
- Talking Machines
- The Allusionist
