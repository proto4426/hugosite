Tonight I'm trying out the **DiagrammeR** R package, one of the [html widgets](http://www.htmlwidgets.org/) javascript bindings for R. I happen to be trying to make a copule flowcharts for research right now, and I figure this is a good way to procrastinate while feeling like I'm learning something.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(DiagrammeR)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("DiagrammeR")
library(DiagrammeR)
```

What's inside?

```{r}
ls("package:DiagrammeR")
```

Following the video on the [website](http://rich-iannone.github.io/DiagrammeR/)

```{r, eval = TRUE}
grViz("
  digraph boxes_and_circles{
  
  node [shape = box]
  A; B; C; D
  
  
  }
      ")
```


The video is nice, but to really learn how to use the package check out the [docs](http://rich-iannone.github.io/DiagrammeR/docs.html) on the website. There are apparently two graphing engines the packages uses, `grViz` and `mermaid`. As an exercise to get familiar with the package, I'll try using both to diagram a hierarchical model from my Bayes homework.


```{r}
grViz("
digraph bayesModel {
graph [overlap = true, fontsize = 10]

  # I'll make the data a triangle
  node [shape = triangle,
        fontname = Helvetica]
  y
  
  # parameters will be boxes
  node [shape = box,
        fontname = Helvetica]
  theta; sigma2; mu; tau2; lambda; phi2; psi; 
  delta; gamma; omega2; c; d

  # distributions will be circles.
  node [shape = circle,
        fixedsize = false,
        width = 0.9] // sets as circles
  normal1 normal2 normal3 normal4 invGamma1 invGamma2

  # several 'edge' statements
  {gamma omega2}->normal1->lambda 
  {c d}->invGamma1->phi2
  {lambda phi2}->normal2->mu
  {psi delta}->invGamma2->tau2
  {mu tau2}->normal3->theta
  {theta sigma2}->normal4->y
}
")

```


Here's mermaid [*edit: this is a screenshot, since the auto-generated javascript was messing up the formatting of my RMarkdown rendering*]: 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mermaid("
graph TD
  a[gamma]-->c(normal1)
  b[omega2]-->c(normal1)
  c-->d[lambda]
  e[c]-->g(invGamma1)
  f[d]-->g(invGamma1)
  g-->h[phi2]
  d-->k(normal2)
  h-->k(normal2)
  k-->l[mu]
  m[psi]-->o(invGamma2)
  n[delta]-->o(invGamma2)
  o(invGamma2)-->p[tau2]
  l-->q(normal3)
  p-->q(normal3)
  q-->r[theta]
  r-->t(normal4)
  s[sigma2]-->t(normal4)
  t-->u>y]
")
```

I can't say I found this particularly efficient--mermaid felt especially cumbersome to code, despite straightforward syntax--but it's possible that with practice I could find it useful. Or that there are shortcuts that I'm missing. Also it was unclear whether important things like LaTeX math are supported. I do like the output though.
