I'm currently watching [Socrata's](http://www.socrata.com/) introductory webinar. Thinking about how far the open data movement has to go to in the context of water science. 

I found myself at the website after browsing the links from a [TED talk on NYC open data insights](http://www.ted.com/talks/ben_wellington_how_we_found_the_worst_place_to_park_in_new_york_city_using_big_data#t-26973). I had only vaguely been aware of Socrata in the past, but it looks to be catching on:

I won't pretend to know more than I do about Socrata, but I think [this graphic](http://image.slidesharecdn.com/bigdatapresentationallthreespeakers-130303073958-phpapp01/95/big-data-session-presentations-6-1024.jpg?cb=1362337090) pretty well sums up their mission:

Alas, I am all too familiar with the levels 1 and 2 in my encounters with government databases. But looking at this I realize that while I see the potential for improvement, I don't have the data chops to get much past level 3. Here is where I admit humility and laud the efforts of real experts (and dream of one day joining them). 

So that's Socrata, another thing I'll be keeping tabs on.
