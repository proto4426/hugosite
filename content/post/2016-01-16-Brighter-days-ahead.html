<p>I’ve been daydreaming in the dark about longer daylight hours, so I drew some pictures to cheer myself up.</p>
<p>Here’s one of day length (sunrise to sunset) for the next 2 months (here in Amherst, MA, that is):</p>

<p>Ahh, things are ramping up. And more quicly every day.</p>
<p>Now here’s a picture of the sunrise and sunset times:</p>

<p>Yes, daylight savings is less than 2 months away!</p>
<p>I also drew some pictures with a wider field of view. Here’s day lengths for the next year:</p>

<p>Even though it’s almost a month since the solstice the days are very near the minimum length. But not for long.</p>
<p>And the sunrise / sunsets for the next year:</p>
<p><img src="/post/2016-01-16-Brighter-days-ahead_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>I always love a beautiful sunrise / sunset. How often do you get to see both in the same picture?</p>
