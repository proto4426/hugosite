<p>I’m on a train back from Boston after attending the 2015 Open Data Science Conference. Two days of serious nerding out among afficionados of open-source software like R and Python. Herein I give some highlights. Notes from talks and workshops I attended are <a href="../Wiki/Events/ODSC2015.html">here</a></p>

<p>Some main points:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Data scientists do a lot of different things, and it’s still not clear what the job title refers to. <a href="http://blog.cloudera.com/blog/2013/10/meet-the-project-founder-josh-wills/">Josh Wills</a> of <a href="http://www.cloudera.com">Cloudera</a> says it’s a person who (1) knows more about statistics than any software developer, and (2) knows more about software development than any statistician. I have work to do on both fronts.</p></li>
<li><p>Lots of people are advocating for open data–for governments of all levels, NGOs and development institutions, and the private sector. Several talks on this. <a href="http://www.opendatascience.com/blog/keeping-governments-accountable-with-open-data-science-cezary-podkul/">Here’s one.</a>. I love this stuff because it feels like data science coming out into the world and making a difference that isn’t just a marketing insight.</p></li>
<li><p>Feature engineering is emerging as one of the most important tools in predictive modeling. This goes hand-in-hand with an emphasis on domain knowledge. To me this sounds a lot like the goal of traditional science, going back to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_causes">Aistotle</a>: figure out the cause of the observed effect. So a cynic might say that the overinflated empiricism of the data-science community has let out a little air, recognizing that, <em>yes</em>, there is such a thing as causality, and <em>yes</em>, it is a useful thing to seek out (something you can’t do with a learning algorithm). Of course this is totally compatible with the idea that data science is a useful complement to deduction-based science.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Other stuff: I got an introduction to running Hadoop in the cloud with Amazon Web Services. Unclear if I’ll ever have reason to use this, but I do like the nerd cred this gets me.</p>
